# Advanced_MicroProcessor
The baseline code belongs to UCSD Professor Dean Tullsen.  
Since the base code will be re-used for the future iterations of the class, I cannot make the repository public thus have to use GitFront.io to show
this repo.  
The original repository contains a separate branche for each optimization where I make all my analysis and show my optimizations. The code that you are about to see 
is the the final version where I combine all my optimizations.
